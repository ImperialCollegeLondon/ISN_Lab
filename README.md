Github is quite a versatile system. We can use it primarily to track issues we have in the development and testing of our TI stimulator and the PL_EEG. The other obvious use is to aid in the development of MATLAB code for our analysis pipelines. Common processes can be written as functions, easily imported into any new analysis script.
